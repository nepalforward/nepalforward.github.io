### Under-priviledged kids

We select kids from remote areas based on specific criteria.
Each child has his own story, but all of them would not access proper education without sponsoring.

They are the first generation of their area to go to school and they live in places where education is not granted.

### School system in Nepal

The Nepalese school in Nepal is divided into government schools and private schools. (...)

School curriculum ends with the SLC (School Level Certificate) after class 10, after which children can apply for college (class 11 and 12).
We propose to sponsor these children until they finish school and get the SLC certificate.

### Basic needs

With the money we manage to raise, we provide the kids with materials (textbooks, pen, school cloths), we pay for private school fees, and we provide continuous support throughout the year.
150â‚¬ is all it takes to provide one year of proper education to one child.

### Consequences

We hope that the consequences of broad education in Nepal will be huge. 

- Sending these kids to school will directly help them, by providing new opportunities (jobs, carreer, personnal fulfilment)
- After being well educated, this generation will care about education and provide their children with proper education, and so on. Once started, no one can stop the spread of proper education.
- Sponsoring the kids will raise awereness about the benefits of education in remote areas
- Going to school will prevent cast discrimination and offer new opportunities to children from low casts
